755,"11/ Clearly, Elon knows how bad this can be. Hence his efforts to end the epidemic by force of will alone. Unfortunately, that won't cut it with this crisis, nor will it be enough to save Tesla from what's coming. $TSLA $TSLAQ
https://t.co/whX3HGaMH3",1,10,2020-03-26 15:13:02
756,"10/ Yet it appears that US auto sales could well fall by far more. That would be absolutely catastrophic for $TSLA. Sure, Elon's stable of kept analysts and reporters will talk about an inevitable recovery, but that requires time, and time is money. $TSLAQ
https://t.co/aF1Mel7CsZ",0,10,2020-03-26 15:13:01

https://t.co/sGt0EMIRhs",0,6,2020-03-26 15:13:01
758,"8/ Thus, it's no surprise that Elon keeps trying to downplay the #covid19 epidemic, even as he tries to drape himself in the trappings of the tech savior delivering essential ventilators (and we wonder how long he can maintain his Schrodinger's Epidemic shtick). $TSLA $TSLAQ",0,8,2020-03-26 15:13:01
759,"7/ As @BradMunchen said today, it is far from clear whether $TSLA can remain solvent (thread highly recommended) through this crisis and its aftermath. The collapse of $GM during the last financial crisis is a far better case study of $TSLAQ than $F.
https://t.co/FSIN6WZZ5j",0,4,2020-03-26 15:13:01
760,"6/ With Fremont closed, cash burn is set to intensify. Meanwhile, the economic scars of the #covid19 outbreak are set to depress luxury goods spending severely. $TSLA has managed to raise $$$ at an outrageous valuation, but that fresh cash could well be spent by mid-year. $TSLAQ",1,8,2020-03-26 15:13:00
761,"5/ $TSLA was a very different, far smaller co. during the last recession. Its liabilities &amp; operating overhead were a tiny fraction of what they are now. Even a mild recession can disrupt spending on expensive goods like cars. Luxury cars tend to suffer worst of all. $TSLAQ",1,6,2020-03-26 15:13:00
762,"4/ In recent years, Elon's made a habit of pointing out that Tesla is the only automaker besides Ford to never go bankrupt. While that may seem to be a grand accomplishment, it's only been achieved thanks to the market‚Äôs extreme generosity. $TSLA $TSLAQ $F
https://t.co/whX3HGaMH3",1,8,2020-03-26 15:13:00
763,"3/ When an economy is expanding, capital tends to move freely. Such was the case during the long &amp; stable post-Great Recession bull market. Yet, as $TSLA's growth narrative has faltered, so, too, has the expansion. The #covid19 outbreak killed the bull, and may kill $TSLAQ",1,6,2020-03-26 15:13:00
764,"2/ Tesla is still reliant on external capital sources. It has had to tap capital markets regularly in order to fund its ongoing operations.
